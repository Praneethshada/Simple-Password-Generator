# Simple-Password-Generator

A simple web-based password generator that creates an 8-character password based on user input. This project demonstrates basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript concepts.

## Features

  - Two digits extracted from the date of birth.
- **Password Display**: Displays the generated password on a separate page.
- **Navigation**: Includes a button to return to the main page for generating another password.

2. Enter your first name, last name, and date of birth.
3. Click the **Generate Password** button:
   - A password is generated based on your inputs.
   - You are redirected to the `password.html` page to view the generated password.
4. Click **Return to Main** to go back to the main page.
